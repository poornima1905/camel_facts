            "There are two main species of camels: the Dromedary (one hump) and the Bactrian (two humps).",
            "Contrary to popular belief, camels' humps do not store water. Instead, they store fat, which can be converted to energy when food is scarce.",
            "Camels can drink up to 40 gallons of water in one go and can survive for weeks without water, depending on the temperature.",
            "Camels can tolerate a body temperature fluctuation of up to 6 degrees Celsius (11 degrees Fahrenheit) to help conserve water.",
            "The thick fur on a camel's body helps insulate them from the heat during the day and keeps them warm at night.",
            "Camels have long eyelashes and a third eyelid that protects their eyes from sand and dust.",
            "Camels have thick skin on their knees, which allows them to kneel comfortably on hot sand.",
            "Camels are social creatures and often live in groups called caravans, which can consist of up to 30 camels.",
            "Camels have wide, padded feet that help them walk on sand without sinking.",
            "Camels are herbivores and can eat a variety of plants, including thorny ones, thanks to their tough mouths.",
            "Camels can live for about 40 to 50 years in captivity.",
            "Camels communicate through a variety of sounds, including grunts, groans, and bellows.",
            "Camels can run at speeds of up to 40 miles per hour (64 km/h) for short distances.",
            "In many cultures, camels are referred to as the 'ships of the desert' due to their ability to carry heavy loads across arid landscapes.",
            "Camel milk is highly nutritious and is a staple food for many desert-dwelling communities. It contains less fat than cow's milk and is rich in vitamins and minerals."
